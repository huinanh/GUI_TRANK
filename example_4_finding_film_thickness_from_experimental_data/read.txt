This GUI v1.0 bases on the TRANK_fit_spectra.py, namely, is used to calculate n and k when thickness is known.

I made several changes to the previous code in order to display figs on those existing canvas which I will list below. Now the GUI presents results for one pass at a time, but such way of display can be switched to like presenting results for two passes for better comparison.

And as for input, by now we can only tell the GUI where to find the input file but we still have to modify the basic_setup every time we use this code. We need to discuss further to make a list of requisite input parameters which are expected to be enough for calculation.

Changes: 

1.Set the thread for calculation to cpu_count-1 or the speed of plotting will be rather slow;

2.Using matplotlib.figure to plot instead of pylab. Though pylab is starightforward, it might cause confusions when there are several axes;

3.Return axes instead of figures, through that we can view all the pages by clicking the Prev or Next, and since we can store any images when viewing them, I deleted the auto-save sentences.
